><P
>This document contains a few terms that may need more detailed 
explanations before you read them. This section will try to cover the most 
obvious ones and how I have chosen to use them within this document.
   </P
><P
>Connection - This is
generally referred to in this document as a series of packets relating to each
other. These packets refer to each other as an established kind of connection.
A connection is in another word a series of exchanged packets. In TCP, this
mainly means establishing a connection via the 3-way handshake, and then this
is considered a connection until the release handshake.
   </P
><P
>DNAT - Destination Network
Address Translation. DNAT refers to the technique of
translating the Destination IP address of a packet,
or to change it simply put. This is used together with
SNAT to allow several hosts to share a single
Internet routable IP address, and to still provide
Server Services. This is normally done by assigning different ports with an
Internet routable IP address, and then tell the Linux
router where to send the traffic.
   </P
><P
>IPSEC - Internet Protocol
Security is a protocol used to encrypt IPv4 packets
and sending them securely over the Internet. For more information on
IPSEC, look in the <A
HREF="a13413.htm"
><I
>Other resources and links</I
></A
> appendix for other resources on the
topic.
   </P
><P
>Kernel space - This is
more or less the opposite of User space. This implies
the actions that take place within the kernel, and not outside of the kernel.
   </P
><P
>Packet - A singular unit sent
over a network, containing a header and a data portion. For example, an
IP packet or an TCP packet.
In Request For Comments
(RFC's) a packet isn't so generalized, instead
IP packets are called datagrams, while
TCP packets are called segments. I have chosen to
call pretty much everything packets in this document for simplicity.
   </P
><P
>QoS - Quality of Service is a way
of specifying how a packet should be handled and what kind of service quality
it should receive while sending it. For more information on this topic, take a
look in the <A
HREF="c171.htm"
><I
>TCP/IP repetition</I
></A
> chapter as well as the <A
HREF="a13413.htm"
><I
>Other resources and links</I
></A
> appendix for
external resources on the subject.
   </P
><P
>Segment - A
TCP segment is pretty much the same as an packet, but
a formalized word for a TCP packet. 
   </P
><P
>Stream - This term refers to a
connection that sends and receives packets that are related to each other in
some fashion. Basically, I have used this term for any kind of connection that
sends two or more packets in both directions. In TCP
this may mean a connection that sends a SYN and then
replies with an SYN/ACK, but it may also mean a
connection that sends a SYN and then replies with an
ICMP Host unreachable. In other words, I use this
term very loosely.
   </P
><P
>SNAT - Source
Network Address Translation. This refers to the techniques used
to translate one source address to another in a packet. This is used to make
it possible for several hosts to share a single Internet routable
IP address, since there is currently a shortage of
available IP addresses in
IPv4 (IPv6 will solve
this).
   </P
><P
> 
State - This term refers to
which state the packet is in, either according to <A
HREF="a13413.htm#RFC793"
><I
>RFC 793 - Transmission Control Protocol</I
></A
> or according to userside states used in
Netfilter/iptables. Note that the used states
internally, and externally, do not follow the RFC 793

specification fully. The main reason is that
Netfilter has to make several assumptions about the
connections and packets.
   </P
><P
>User space - With this
term I mean everything and anything that takes place outside the kernel. For
example, invoking iptables -h takes place outside the
kernel, while iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -j ACCEPT takes
place (partially) within the kernel, since a new rule is added to the
ruleset.
   </P
><P
>Userland - See User space.
   </P
><P
>VPN - Virtual Private Network is
a technique used to create virtually private networks over non-private
networks, such as the Internet. IPSEC is one
technique used to create VPN connections.
OpenVPN is another.
