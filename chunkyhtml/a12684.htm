>You may run into a few problems with loading modules. For example, you could
get errors claiming that there is no module by such a name and so on. This may,
for example look like the following.</P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>insmod: iptable_filter: no module by that name found</PRE
><P
>   This is no reason for concern yet. This or these modules may possibly
have been statically compiled into your kernel. This is the first thing you
should look at when trying to solve this problem. The simplest way to see if
these modules have been loaded already or if they are statically compiled into
the kernel, is to simply try and run a command that uses the specific
functionality. In the above case, we could not load the
filter table. If this functionality is not there, we
should be unable to use the filter table at all. To
check if the filter table is there, we do the
following.
   </P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>iptables -t filter -L
   </PRE
><P
>   This should either output all of the chains in the
filter table properly, or it should fail. If everything
is o.k., then it should look something like this depending on if you have
rules inserted or not.
   </P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)

>   If you do not have the filter table loaded, you
would get an error that looks something like this instead.

Perhaps iptables or your kernel needs to be upgraded.
    </PRE
><P
>This is a bit more serious since it points out that we, first of all, do not
have the functionality compiled into the kernel, and second, that the module is
not possible to find in our normal module paths. This may either mean that you
have forgotten to install your modules, you have forgotten to run
depmod -a to update your module databases, or you have not
compiled the functionality as either module or statically into the kernel. 
There may of course be other reasons for the module not to be loaded, but these 
are the main reasons. Most of these problems are easily solved. The first 
problem would simply be solved by running make 
modules_install in the kernel source directory (if the source has 
already been compiled and the modules have already been built). The second 
problem is solved by simply running depmod -a once and see 
if it works afterward. The third problem is a bit out of the league for this 
explanation, and you are more or less left to your own wits here. You will most 
probably find more information about this on the <A

   </P

>Another error that you may get when running iptables is the following error.
   </P
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
   </PRE
><P
>   This error tells us that there is no such chain, target or match. This could
depend upon a huge set of factors, the most common being that you have
misspelled the chain, target or match in question. Also, this could be
generated in case you are trying to use a match that is not available, either
because you did not load the proper module, it was not compiled into the 
kernel, or iptables failed to automatically load the module. In general, you 
should look for all of the above solutions but also look for misspelled targets 
of some sort or another in your rule.
