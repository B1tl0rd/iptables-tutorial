>One side of iptables and netfilter that we haven't looked at very much yet, is 
the graphical user interfaces that are available for iptables and netfilter. 
One of the biggest problems with this is that netfilter is a very complex and 
flexible setup, that can perform the strangest of tasks. For this reason, 
it can become a very daunting task to create a GUI
for netfilter.
    </P
><P
>Several persons and organisations have tried to create
GUI's for netfilter and iptables, and some have
succeeded better than others, while others have given up after some time. All
have different reasoning behind their tries as well, so it isn't an easy task
to show them all. However, this chapter is a small compilation of some of the
GUI's for iptables and netfilter that may be worth
looking at. Suggestions on others to add are always welcome.

>Firewall Builder, or simply fwbuilder, is an extremely versatile and powerful 
tool that can be used to build your own firewalls, or to maintain several 
firewalls for that matter. It can be used to create policies for several 
different types of firewalls, including iptables
(Linux 2.4 and 2.6), ipfilter 
(freebsd, netbsd, etc), openbsd
pf, and, a module that must be bought, 
Cisco PIX.
      </P
><P
>Fwbuilder has, as you can see, a very big audience
and is well taken care of and continues to be developed. It is run on a
separate host system, where you create the policy files, and then copy them
over and run them on the target system. It is able to handle everything from
very simple rulesets to large and rather complicated ones. It has extensive
abilities to handle different versions and installations of
iptables, by configuration of which targets/matches
are available on each host system, etcetera. The end result may be saved in an
xml file, or a system parsable configuration file (e.g., the real firewall
scripts).
