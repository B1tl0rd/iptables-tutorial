>This document could either be read as a reference or from start to end. It was 
originally written as a small introduction to iptables and to some extent 
netfilter, but this focus has changed over the years. It aims at being an as 
complete reference as possibly to iptables and netfilter and to at least give 
a basic and fast primer or repetition to the areas that you might need to 
understand. It should be noted that this document will not, nor will it be 
able to, deal with specific bugs inside or outside the scope of iptables and 
netfilter, nor does it really deal with how to get around bugs like this. 
   </P
><P
>If you find peculiar bugs or behaviors in iptables or any of the subcomponents, 
you should contact the Netfilter mailing lists and tell them about the problem 
and they can tell you if this is a real bug or if it has already been fixed.
There are security related bugs found in iptables and Netfilter, 
one or two do slip by once in a while, it's inevitable. These are properly 
shown on the front page of the <A
HREF="http://www.netfilter.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Netfilter 
main page</A
>, and that is where you should go to get information on such 
topics.
   </P
><P
>The above also implies that the rule-sets available with this tutorial are
not written to deal with actual bugs inside Netfilter. The main goal of
them is to simply show how to set up rules in a nice simple fashion that
deals with all problems we may run into. For example, this tutorial will
not cover how we would close down the HTTP port for the simple reason that
Apache happens to be vulnerable in version 1.2.12 (This is covered really,
though not for that reason).
   </P
><P
>This document was written to give everyone a good and simple primer
at how to get started with iptables, but at the same time it was created
to be as complete as possible. It does not contain any targets or matches
that are in patch-o-matic for the simple reason that it would require too
much effort to keep such a list updated. If you need information about
the patch-o-matic updates, you should read the info that comes with it in
patch-o-matic as well as the other documentations available on the <A
HREF="http://www.netfilter.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Netfilter main page</A
>.
   </P
><P
>If you have any suggestions on additions or if you think you find any problems 
around the area of iptables and netfilter not covered in this document feel 
free to contact me about this. I will be more than happy to take a look at it 
and possibly add what might be missing.
