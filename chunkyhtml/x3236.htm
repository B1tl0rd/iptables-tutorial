>As we have already explained to some extent, there are quite a lot of 
minor caveats with using NAT. The main problem is
certain protocols and applications which may not work at all. Hopefully, these
applications are not too common in the networks that you administer, and in
such case, it should cause no huge problems. 
    </P
><P
>The second and smaller problem is applications and protocols which will only 
work partially. These protocols are more common than the ones that will not 
work at all, which is quite unfortunate, but there isn't very much we can do 
about it as it seems. If complex protocols continue to be built, this is a 
problem we will have to continue living with. Especially if the protocols 
aren't standardized.
    </P
><P
>The third, and largest problem, in my point of view, is the fact that the user
who sits behind a NAT server to get out on the
internet will not be able to run his own server. It could be done, of course,
but it takes a lot more time and work to set this up. In companies, this is
probably preferred over having tons of servers run by different employees that
are reachable from the Internet, without any supervision. However, when it
comes to home users, this should be avoided to the very last. You should never
as an Internet service provider NAT your customers from a private IP range to
a public IP. It will cause you more trouble than it is worth having to deal
with, and there will always be one or another client which will want this or
that protocol to work flawlessly. When it doesn't, you will be called down
upon.
     </P
><P
>As one last note on the caveats of NAT, it should be
mentioned that NAT is actually just a hack more or
less. NAT was a solution that was worked out while
the <SPAN

CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>IANA</I
></SPAN
> and other organisations noted that the Internet
grew exponentially, and that the IP addresses would soon be in shortage.
NAT was and is a short term solution to the problem
of the IPv4 (Yes, IP which we have talked about
before is a short version of IPv4 which stands for
Internet Protocol version 4). The long term solution to the
IPv4 address shortage is the
IPv6 protocol, which also solves a ton of other
problems. IPv6 has 128 bits assigned to their
addresses, while IPv4 only have 32 bits used for IP
addresses. This is an incredible increase in address space. It may seem like
ridiculous to have enough IP addresses to set one IP address for every atom in
our planet, but on the other hand, noone expected the
IPv4 address range to be too small either.
