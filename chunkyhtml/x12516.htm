>The Integrated Secure Communications System, or shortly ISCS, is still 
undergoing development, and no public version has been released. However, this 
looks like it will become an extremely helpful tool once it is finished. The 
developer has very high standards, and this is the main reason that it has not 
been released yet. ISCS integrates several functionalities into a single suite 
of administration and management user interface. Basically this means that once 
this project is released, you will be able to fully configure all your 
firewalls from a centralized point using a single GUI, including VPN's, VLAN's, 
Tunnels, sysctl's, etcetera.
      </P
><P
>The main attack angle that the developer(s) of ISCS has, is to simplify 
management and administration and to remove tedious work for the 
administrators, so to save as much work hours as possible for the 
administrators. This is done by putting together policies, and then the 
programs creates the rulesets and "pushes" them out to the "enforcements 
points" (e.g., firewalls, proxies, etcetera). The administrator doesn't 
actually "write" or "click" together the rulesets, just simply put together 
policies that are then enforced by ISCS.
      </P

>This tool isn't finished yet, as of writing this. However, I have been in touch 
with the main developer of this project before, and this is indeed a very large 
project. When it is finished, I believe this will be one of the best tools on 
the market. Of course, time can only tell, but it is well worth mentioning 
here. You can find the ISCS project over at <A

>The main developer, John Sullivan, of ISCS has specifically asked me to ask 
people to join his development efforts. The project is very big, and he would 
definitely like as much help with the project as possible. If you are able to 
help, you are, in other words, more than welcome.
