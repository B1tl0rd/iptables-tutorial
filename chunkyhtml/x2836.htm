>TCP/IP has grown in complexity quite a lot when it
comes to the routing part. In the beginning, most people thought it would be
enough with destination driven routing. The last few years, this has become
more and more complex however. Today, Linux can route on basically every
single field or bit in the IP header, and even based
on TCP, UDP or
ICMP headers as well. This is called policy based
routing, or advanced routing.
      </P
><P
>This is simply a brief discussion on how the destination driven routing is 
performed. When we send a packet from a sending host, the packet is created. 
After this, the computer looks at the packet destination address and compares
it to the routing table that it has. If the destination address is local, the
packet is sent directly to that address via its hardware
MAC address. If the packet is on the other side of a
gateway, the packet is sent to the MAC address of the
gateway. The gateway will then look at the IP headers
and see the destination address of the packet. The destination address is
looked up in the routing table again, and the packet is sent to the next
gateway, et cetera, until the packet finally reaches the local network of the
destination.
      </P
><P
>As you can see, this routing is very basic and simple. With the advanced
routing and policy based routing, this gets quite a bit more complex. We can
route packets differently based on their source address for example, or their
TOS value, et cetera.
