<P>
The PDF version of this tutorial has been temporarily downed until I can 
get the conversion from docbook SGML to PDF to work properly again. It 
works for me, but nowhere else for some really strange reason. Until this 
has been fixed, you will have to survive without it. If there are any 
jade/docbook gurus out there reading this, you are more than welcome to 
grab the source package above and have a look at it :-).

<P>
For those who have noticed, the tutorial has gone up and down too and 
forth the last month or two. My apologies for this. <A 
HREF="http://www.boingworld.com">www.boingworld.com</A> seems 
to have gone down for an undefinite period of time, and after this I had 
several problems finding a host both willing and able to host the 
tutorial. My gratitude goes out to the following people/organisations for 
their kind help, support and temporary hosting during this time:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.linux-sxs.org">Linux-SXS</A> who took the lion 
part of this traffic on their already overloaded servers. Special thanks 
go out to Lonni Friedmann and Douglas J Hunley
<LI><A HREF="http://www.netfilter.org">Netfilter.org</A> and the core team 
for help, and for preparing a host/mirror of this tutorial. Will hopefully 
go through in the future.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.unix-fu.org">Unix-fu.org</A> for taking some of 
the beating in the beginning, and for being the main host quite some time 
ago.
<LI><A HREF="http://www.haringstad.com">Haringstad.com</A> for the "final 
solution" hopefully. A huge thanks to Jacco van Koll for this possibility.
<LI>And everyone else who has and still are maintaining mirrors. 
</UL>

<P>
I hope I didn't forget anyone here, and if I did, let me know and I will 
have him/her/them added.

<P> Do note that some people reported broken links to me for the old version of
the tutorial, which was due to bad line wrappings in my editor of choice.
Hopefully this should now be fixed. If there  is any other suggestions(broken
links, general problems, you name it), send a mail to me at the listed mail
adress.

<P> Other than this, there are a lot of minor changes, additions, deletions and
so on. I am currently working feverishly on the rc.firewall file chapter to get
it up to date with the script, however I have noticed how badly written this is
so I am more or less rewriting the whole chapter so it may look a bit weird in
some places.

<P>
For all of those that mails me and ask questions that are not
strictly related to the actual tutorial, I would like to ask you to stop mailing
me and ask me to look through your scripts and so on. If you have found a bug or
error in the tutorial, or want to contribute, you are more than welcome,
however, I get between 20 and 70 mail per week as it is now asking questions on
everything from "how do I do this" to "why doesn't my iptables setup let xxx
through to xxx" or "Want to see me nude". Anything like this will in the future
be either sent to /dev/null, or forwarded to the netfilter mailing list which
you can reach at <A HREF="mailto:netfilter@lists.samba.org">netfilter at
lists.samba.org</A>. For more information on this, visit the <A
HREF="http://www.netfilter.org">netfilter official homepage</A>. I will, of
course, try to monitor the mailing list as intensely as I can, and I am sure
that the awfully nice people over there will help me out by pointing out any
mistakes I have done here if you find shortcomings and point them out there. I
also got a generous offer from the equally nice people at linuxsecurity.com to
do this screening if you send mail to their mailing list at <A
HREF="mailto:security-discuss@linuxsecurity.com">security-discuss@linuxsecurity.
com</A>. Both are fairly large, and should be able to help you much much better
than I can.

<P> I would like to give a huge thanks to <A
HREF="http://www.ericsson.com/rsa">Ericsson Radio Access</A> for their generous
contribution to this project. Thanks to them, I now have a fully functional <A
HREF="/lab-net/index.html">labb network</A>.

<P> NOTE: If you feel like mirroring this tutorial, please tell me about it so I
can tell people about your mirror. This way it is possible for me to get some of
the traffic off this server which may get heavily overloaded. Also note the cron
script that will help you to do automatic updates of the tutorial.
