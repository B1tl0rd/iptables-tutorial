  <title id="saveandrestore.title">Saving and restoring large rulesets</title>

  <para>
The <command>iptables</command> package comes with two more tools that 
are very useful, specially if you are dealing with larger rulesets. These 
two tools are called <command>iptables-save</command> and 
<command>iptables-restore</command> and are used to save and restore 
rulesets to a specific fileformat that looks a quite a bit different from 
the standard shell code that you will see in the rest of this tutorial.
  </para>

  <section>
   <title>Speed considerations</title>

   <para>
One of the largest reasons for using the <command>iptables-save</command> 
and <command>iptables-restore</command> commands is that they will speed 
up the loading and saving of larger rulesets considerably. The main 
problem with running a shell script that contains  
<command>iptables</command> rules is that each invocation of 
<command>iptables</command> within the script will first extract the 
whole ruleset from the netfilter kernel space, and after this, it will 
insert or append rules, or do whatever change to the ruleset that is
needed by this specific command. Finally, it will insert the new ruleset 
from its own memory into kernel space. Using a shell script, this is done 
for each and every rule that we want to insert, and for each time we do 
this, it takes more time to extract and insert the ruleset.
   </para>

   <para>
To solve this problem, there is the <command>iptables-save</command> and 
<command>restore</command> commands. The <command>iptables-save</command> 
command is used to save the ruleset into a specially formatted textfile, 
and the <command>iptables-restore</command> command is used to load this 
textfile into kernel again. The best parts of these commands is that they 
will load and save the ruleset in one single request.  
<command>iptables-save</command> will grab the whole ruleset from kernel 
and save it to a file in one single movement. 
<command>iptables-restore</command> will upload that specific ruleset to 
kernel in a single movement for each table. In other words, instead of 
dropping the ruleset out of kernel some 30.000 times, for really large 
rulesets, and then upload it to kernel again that many times, we can now 
save the whole thing into a file in one movement and then upload the 
whole thing in as little as three movements depending on how many tables 
you use.
   </para>

   <para>
As you can understand, these tools are definitely something for you if 
you are working on a huge set of rules that needs to be inserted. However, 
they do have drawbacks that we will discuss more in the next section.
   </para>

   <title>Drawbacks with restore</title>

   <para>
As you may have already wondered, can <command>iptables-restore</command> 
handle any kind of scripting? So far, no, it can not and it will most 
probably never be able to. This is the main flaw in using 
<command>iptables-restore</command> since you will not be able to
do a huge set of things with these files. For example, what if you have a
connection that has a dynamically assigned IP address and you want to 
grab this dynamic IP everytime the computer boots up and then use that 
value within your scripts? With <command>iptables-restore</command>, this 
is more or less impossible.
   </para>

   <para>
One possibility to get around this is to make a small script which grabs 
the values you would like to use in the script, then sed the 
<command>iptables-restore</command> file for specific keywords and replace 
them with the values collected via the small script. At this point, you 
could save it to a temporary file, and then use 
<command>iptables-restore</command> to load the new values. This causes a 
lot of problems however, and you will be unable to use 
<command>iptables-save</command> properly since it would probably erase 
your manually added keywords in the restore script. It is in other words a 
clumsy solution.
   </para>

   <para>
Another solution is to load the <command>iptables-restore</command> 
scripts first, and then load a specific shell script that inserts more 
dynamic rules in their proper places. Of course, as you can understand, 
this is just as clumsy as the first solution. 
<command>iptables-restore</command> is simply not very well suited for 
configurations where IP addresses are dynamically assigned to your 
firewall or where you want different behaviours depending on configuration 
options and so on.
   </para>

   <para>
Another drawback with <command>iptables-restore</command> and 
<command>iptables-save</command> is that it is not fully functional as of 
writing this. The problem is simply that not a lot of people use it as of 
today and hence there is not a lot of people finding bugs, and in turn 
some matches and targets will simply be inserted badly, which may lead to 
some strange behaviours that you did not expect. Even though these 
problems exist, I would highly recommend using these tools which should 
work extremely well for most rulesets as long as they do not contain some 
of the new targets or matches that it does not know how to handle 
properly.
   </para>

  <section>
   <title>iptables-save</title>

   <para>
The <command>iptables-save</command> command is, as we have already 
explained, a tool to save the current ruleset into a file that 
<command>iptables-restore</command> can use. This command is quite simple 
really, and takes only two arguments. Take a look at the following 
example to understand the syntax of the command.
   </para>

   <para>
    <cmdsynopsis>
     <command>iptables-save</command>
     <arg choice="opt">-c</arg>
     <arg choice="opt">-t <replaceable>table</replaceable></arg>
    </cmdsynopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
The <command>-c</command> argument tells <command>iptables-save</command> 
to keep the values specified in the byte and packet counters. This could 
for example be useful if we would like to reboot our main firewall, but 
not loose byte and packet counters which we may use for statistical 
purposes. Issuing a <command>iptables-save</command> command with the 
<command>-c</command> argument would then make it possible for us to 
reboot but without breaking our statistical and accounting routines. The 
default value is, of course, to not keep the counters intact when issuing 
this command.
   </para>

   <para>
The <command>-t</command> argument tells the 
<command>iptables-save</command> command which tables to save. Without
this argument the command will automatically save all tables available 
into the file. The following is an example on what output you can expect 
from the <command>iptables-save</command> command if you do not have any 
ruleset loaded.
   </para>

   <para>
This contains a few comments starting with a # sign. Each table is marked 
like *&lt;tablename&gt;, for example 
<computeroutput>*mangle</computeroutput>. Then within each table we have 
the chain specifications and rules. A chain specification looks like 
:&lt;chainname&gt; &lt;chainpolicy&gt; 
[&lt;packetcounter&gt;:&lt;bytecounter&gt;]. The  
<computeroutput>chainname</computeroutput> may be for example 
<systemitem>PREROUTING</systemitem>, the policy is described previously 
and can for example be <systemitem>ACCEPT</systemitem>. Finally the 
packetcounter and bytecounters are the same counters as in the output 
from <command>iptables -L -v</command>. Finally, each table declaration 
ends in a <computeroutput>COMMIT</computeroutput> keyword. The 
<computeroutput>COMMIT</computeroutput> keyword tells us that at this 
point we should commit all rules currently in the pipeline to kernel.
   </para>

   <para>
The above example is pretty basic, and hence I believe it is nothing more
than proper to show a brief example which contains a very small <ulink
url="http://iptables-tutorial.frozentux.net/scripts/iptsave-ruleset.txt">
ruleset</ulink>. If we would run <command>iptables-save</command> on 
this, it would look something like this in the output:

   <para>
As you can see, each command has now been prefixed with the byte and 
packet counters since we used the <command>-c</command> argument. Except 
for this, the commandline is quite intact from the script. The only 
problem now, is how to save the output to a file. Quite simple, and you 
should already know how to do this if you have used linux at all before. 
It is only a matter of piping the command output on to the file that you 
would like to save it as. This could look like the following:
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>iptables-save -c > /etc/iptables-save</command>
   </para>

   <para>
The above command will in other words save the whole ruleset to a file 
called <filename>/etc/iptables-save</filename> with byte and packet 
counters still intact.
   </para>

  </section>

  <section>
   <title>iptables-restore</title>

   <para>
The <command>iptables-restore</command> command is used to restore the 
<command>iptables</command> ruleset that was saved with the 
<command>iptables-save</command> command. It takes all the input from 
standard input and can not load from files as of writing this, 
unfortunately. This is the command syntax for iptables-restore:
   </para>

   <para>
    <cmdsynopsis>
     <command>iptables-save</command>
     <arg choice="opt">-c</arg>
     <arg choice="opt">-n</arg>
    </cmdsynopsis>
   </para>

   <para>
The <command>-c</command> argument restores the byte and packet counters 
and must be used if you want to restore counters that was previously saved 
with <command>iptables-save</command>. This argument may also be written 
in its long form <command>--counters</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
The <command>-n</command> argument tells 
<command>iptables-restore</command> to not overwrite the previously 
written rules in the table, or tables, that it is writing to. The default 
behaviour of <command>iptables-restore</command> is to flush and destroy 
all previously inserted rules. The short <command>-n</command> argument 
may also be replaced with the longer format <command>--noflush</command>.
   </para>

   <para>
To load ruleset with the <command>iptables-restore</command> command, we 
could do this in several ways, but we will mainly look at the simplest 
and most common way here.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>cat /etc/iptables-save | iptables-restore -c</command>
   </para>

   <para>
This would cat the ruleset located within the 
<filename>/etc/iptables-save</filename> file and then pipe it to 
<command>iptables-restore</command> which takes the ruleset on the 
standard input and then restores it, including byte and packet counters. 
It is that simple to begin with. This command could be varied until 
oblivion and we could show different piping possibilities, however, this 
is a bit out of the scope of this chapter, and hence we will skip that 
part and leave it as an excercise for the reader to experiment with.
   </para>

   <para>
The ruleset should now be loaded properly to kernel and everything should 
work. If not, you may possibly have run into a bug in these commands, 
however likely that sounds.
